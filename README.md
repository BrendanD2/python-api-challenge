# python-api-challenge

In This challenge we first took a large set of cities by randomly generating longitude and latitude values. We then used the openWeather API to find cities from these latitude and longitute values and find the corresponding temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and date. After this I created graphs to display latitude vs temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. There was not a clear correleation so then I divided up the cities by northern and southern hemisphere and did the same plots. I also found the correlation and the line of best fit for each plot for both hemispheres. The plot that showed the best correlation was the latitude vs temperature plot, showing more correlation for the southern hemisphere. Then, I made a map plot of all the cities that were randomly generated. After this, I used this city data to find hotels near those areas. Before finding the hotels, I reduced by dataset to be cities that met these requirements (max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21, Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s, and Zero cloudiness). Then with the reduced dataset I searched for hotels within a 10,000 m radius of the cities. I then recorded the hotel names and plotted the remaining cities on a map plot with the hotel names included.
